Office hours: By appointment

# IDM Program Objectives

Students will:

* Develop 	**conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create 	opportunities.

* Develop 	**technical skills** to realize their ideas.

* Develop 	**critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.

* Gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.

* Develop 	**collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

# Course Prerequisites

This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a high degree of programming ability. We will be learning computer programing in a platform-generic way, however most examples will be demonstrated in the Processing language (Processing.org).  As the course progresses, we will look at a variety of platforms to see which application fits different needs. Having previous coding experience in Java, C++, or Javascript is a plus, but not necessarily a must. 

# Course Description

This course is a graduate-level, introductory creative programming course, appropriate for students with no prior programming experience. Traditionally, introductory programming teaches algorithmic problem-solving, where a sequence of instructions describe the steps necessary to achieve a desired result. In Creative Coding, students are trained to go beyond this sequential thinking, to think concurrently and modularly. This course will introduce you to a variety of concepts in programming, and how they can be applied creatively to work in a variety of media.  A strong focus will be on creating interactive experiences that involve a variety of non-traditional user interfaces.  By the end of this course, students will be empowered to write and read code for event-driven, object-oriented, graphical user interfaces, as well as code that produces or reacts to sound and light.

Some of the programming environments we will work with include:

### Core:

* Processing: [http://processing.org](http://processing.org/)

* OpenFrameworks: [http://www.openframeworks.cc](http://www.openframeworks.cc/)	

* Arduino: [http://arduino.cc](http://arduino.cc/)	

* P5.js: [http://p5js.org](http://p5js.org/)

* Max: [http://www.cycling74.com](http://www.cycling74.com/)

### Also:

* PureData: [http://puredata.info](http://puredata.info/)

* Real-Time Cmix:[ http://rtcmix.org](http://rtcmix.org/)

* Tone.js: 	[https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js/](https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js/)

# Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

* Understand the basics of creative coding in Java (Processing), C (Arduino), C++ (OpenFrameworks), Javascript (P5.js / Node.js), and through visual patcher languages (Max, PureData).

* Apply their understanding of digital media to software.

* Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real time framework.

* Experiment with different techniques for user input and output, including sensors and non-traditional screens.

* Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project.

# Course Structure

This course will be comprised of 13 weekly classes, 1 final project proposal, and 1 final project. Additionally, there will be small weekly homework assignments, which we will go over and build upon in class. Homework assignments will often be supplemented by reading unless otherwise noted.

# Course requirements

Course requirements include small weekly projects (studies), a project proposal, and a final project & full critique presented to the class. The grading breakdown is as follows:

* Attendance and participation (25%). More than three unexcused absences will result in a decreased letter grade.

* Weekly homework studies published online on the day it is due (35%).	

* IDM coursework documentation using wordpress on [http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu](http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/) 	or on Github.* (5%)

* Final project proposal presented to class (10%).

* Final project. This project can be an interactive tool, a data visualization/sonification exercise, a performance project, or any other approved proposal. Each project must show off creative skills within a software environment you create (25%).

# Final project

For the final project & proposal, students may choose to work individually or in pairs.  If  working as a group, each student is responsible for 50% of the project.  

## Critique explained

As part of the final project presentation, there will also be a project critique.  Critiques are a good way to demo your creative ideas to get immediate feedback from your peers. During the crit, the instructor and fellow classmates will analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Students should review crit notes and reflect upon what was said. How might one combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise? It’s not necessary to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

**Rules of the Critique:**

* Be Present and Engaged

* Give Feedback to your classmates

* Do NOT take feedback personally.

* Have fun!

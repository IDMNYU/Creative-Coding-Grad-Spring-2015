From Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawing #305:

The Eighth point is located halfway between the two points 

where an arc with its center at the first point and with a radius equal to the distance between the first and the seventh points would cross 

(points 3-4:) a line from the upper right corner to a point halfway between the midpoint of the bottom side and the lower right corner.
